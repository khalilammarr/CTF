# CTF Writeups

Welcome to my CTF repository! I'm a beginner starting my journey in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, and I'll be sharing writeups for tasks I solve, along with some tips I learn along the way. My focus is on **Reverse Engineering**, but I'll explore other categories too.

## **About Me**
I'm just starting out in CTFs and cybersecurity, so my writeups might not be perfect, but I hope they help other beginners like me. Feel free to reach out if you have suggestions or feedback!
